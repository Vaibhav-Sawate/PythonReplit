## 📋 Overview

The **Multi-Speaker Voice Personality Analyzer** is an advanced AI-powered web application that analyzes voice recordings to determine personality traits using the Big Five personality model (OCEAN). The application features **automatic speaker identification** for group conversations, allowing it to analyze each person separately using machine learning and psychological research.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **🎙️ Multi-Input Support**: Live recording and file upload (MP3, WAV, M4A)
- **👥 Automatic Speaker Diarization**: Identifies and separates multiple speakers in group conversations
- **🧠 ML-Based Personality Analysis**: Uses advanced machine learning models for accurate trait prediction
- **📊 Interactive Visualizations**: Radar charts and bar graphs powered by Plotly
- **🎭 Big Five Personality Model**: Analyzes Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism
- **🏷️ Personality Archetype Matching**: Matches users to personality archetypes (Creative Innovator, Social Leader, etc.)
- **📈 Additional Trait Analysis**: Confidence level, energy level, speaking pace, and emotional tone
- **💡 Detailed Interpretations**: Research-based personality trait descriptions and insights

### 🔬 Machine Learning Models

#### Personality Prediction Weights
```python
'Openness': {
    'spectral_variety': 0.35,      # Vocal expressiveness
    'pitch_variation': 0.25,       # Emotional range
    'speaking_complexity': 0.20,   # Linguistic complexity
    'vocal_expressiveness': 0.20   # Overall expressiveness
}
```

#### Personality Archetypes
- **Creative Innovator**: High Openness + Moderate Extraversion
- **Reliable Organizer**: High Conscientiousness + Moderate Agreeableness  
- **Social Leader**: High Extraversion + High Agreeableness
- **Empathetic Helper**: High Agreeableness + Low Neuroticism
- **Calm Analyst**: High Conscientiousness + Low Neuroticism
- **Energetic Performer**: High Extraversion + High Openness
- **Thoughtful Researcher**: High Openness + High Conscientiousness
